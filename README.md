### Chat Application via Socket I/O

# Issues / 28 Jun 2016
1.   Messages written by the current user should not be displayed but they are.
2.   It would be better if the user's ID was shown on the other clients' browsers when they log in; i.e., 'Tim has joined' instead of 'New user has joined.'
3.   Change the variable names to more meaningful names, and pass objects instead of strings back and forth.
